M-Sequence Generator
====================

This directory currently contains but one file:

* `mseq.m` — a general m-sequence generator function

I regard this as a “fixed” and “cleaned up” version of
[Giedrius Buracas's m-sequence generation program](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3083-m-sequence-generation-program),
which has (in my opinion) a great deal of strangeness in it.
