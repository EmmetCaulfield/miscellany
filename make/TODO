Refactor to put most commonly used variables at the top, rather than
   standard implicit variables.

Add "help" pseudo-target.

Think about and test orthogonality of different
   pseudo-targets. Consider changes that enable orthogonal use, and
   might reduce the total number of targets. For example 'debug0'
   might be replaced by 'debug O0'
