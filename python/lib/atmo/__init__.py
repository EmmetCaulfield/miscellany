Standard constants and functions for atmospheric calculations.

Functions are provided for "important" properties, usually as a
function of height. Functions are named for the usual letter used to
represent that property. Greek letters are spelled out.

Where such makes any sense, functions that take height as an argument
default to zero, or sea-level, but "go through the motions" performing
any necessary calculations; in principle, they should return the same
value as the given associated constant, if any.

The constants and formulae are fairly standard and (arguably) valid in
the troposphere, although some may not be valid in the surface
boundary layer. YMMV.

Constants are (units in square brackets):

p_0   = 101325         # [Pa] sea level standard atmospheric pressure
T_0   =    288.15      # [K]  sea level standard temperature
g     =      9.80665   # [m/s^2] earth-surface gravitational acceleration
L     =      0.0065    # [K/m] temperature lapse rate
M_a   =      0.0289644 # [kg/mol] molar mass of dry air, kg/mol 
mu_0  =      1.716e-5  # [Pa路s=kg/m路s] sea level dynamic viscosity
nu_0  =      1.460e-5  # [m^2/s] sea level kinematic viscosity
gamma =      1.4       # [1] sea-level static on a standard day
