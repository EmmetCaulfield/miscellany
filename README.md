A semi-organized collection of miscellaneous software.


Overview
========

A random collection of Python and Java software. Hightlights include

  * [WindShearProfile](java/WindShearProfile) — a Java 8 applet demonstrating
    log-law wind shear in the Earth's boundary layer.
  * [BladeTwist](python/BladeTwist) — a Python “applet” demonstrating
    twist of wind turbine blades.
  * [NacaBrowser](python/NacaBrowser) — a Python “applet” that
    displays arbitrary 4-digit NACA airfoil sections.
  * [Miscellaneous simple Python libraries](python/lib/) including
    [vtku](python/lib/vtku/), a python utility module that eases some
    Python/VTK annoyances.
