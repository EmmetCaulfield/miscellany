= HTML

There's only one file here because it's not often that I have a HTML
file that might be useful to anyone else.

The file, <tt>Zoom.html</tt> contains a table and a little JavaScript
that I find helps me avoid entering in numbers for reoccurring Zoom
meetings.

There's a little explanation in the file and it's very plain and
simple.
