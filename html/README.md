# HTML

There's really only one file here because it's not often that I have a HTML
file that might be useful to anyone else.

The file, <tt>Zoom.html</tt> contains a table and a little JavaScript
that I find helps me avoid entering in numbers for reoccurring Zoom
meetings.

There's a little explanation in the file and it's very plain and
simple.

All the other files are just fragments that are put together by the
<tt>Makefile</tt> so it's easy to build a useful version
(<tt>Meetings.html</tt> for work) and an example version
(<tt>Zoom.html</tt> for here) without the rest of it (JavaScript, CSS)
diverging. 

And, yes, I've included a generated file in the repo (which I wouldn't
normally do, of course) so there's a complete example here.
