    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      This file contains a single table of <i>Zoom</i> meetings. You
      can edit it with any text editor and add more rows to the
      table. It's simple enough that almost anyone with a rudimentary
      knowlege of HTML/JavaScript/CSS should be able to understand it
      and modify it as needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the page is loaded, a simple JavaScript function adds an
      extra cell to the end of every table row with a linked camera
      icon that, when you click on it, should launch <i>Zoom</i> and
      connect you to the meeting.
    <p>

    <p>
      I say "should" because there's a chance that it won't work if
      the URL protocol handlers in your browser/OS aren't set up to
      forward <tt>zoommtg://...</tt> URLs to the <i>Zoom</i>
      application or your browser is configured to disallow JavaScript
      for <tt>file://</tt> URLs.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      If the Zoom meeting ID is 10 characters long (usually indicative
      of a personal meeting room), the script sets the <tt>class</tt>
      attribute on the table row element to <tt>pmr</tt>, which is
      currently styled as a pale yellow background (CSS <tt>tr.pmr</tt>).
    <p>
      
    <p>
      There's a further style class (<tt>tr.host</tt>) that you can
      set manually for meetings that you host, currently styled as a
      pale pink background.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also add or delete <em>columns</em> from the table. The
      script will always use the last two cells in each row.
    </p>

    <p>
      I got tired of entering strings of numbers for recurring
      meetings, which I did for 2 months, so I spent an hour writing
      this. If it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces. It makes my
      life a little easier, but YMMV.
