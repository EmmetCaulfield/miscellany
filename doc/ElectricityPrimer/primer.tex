\section{Circuit Diagrams}

Having introduced the zig-zag circuit symbol for a resistor in
Figure~\ref{fig:ohmslaw}, and before proceeding to talk about
alternating current, it is helpful to talk a little about
\term{circuit diagrams} or \term{schematics}.

A circuit diagram depicts circuit elements or components and how they
are connected to each other.

\subsection{Types of Circuit Diagram}

There are really two kinds of circuit diagram, which are somewhat
different, they can describe:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a physical assembly of real-world non-ideal components for assembly/production; and
  \item a theoretical assembly of ideal components for analysis/simulation.
\end{itemize}

The example of Figure~\ref{fig:flashlight} shows a ``production''
schematic for a flashlight: the positive terminal of a 3~\unit{V}
battery is connected via a latching switch to a lamp, the other
terminal of which is connected to the chassis. The battery's negative
terminal is also connected to the chassis, completing the circuit.

Figure~\ref{fig:flashlight} also shows an ``analysis'' schematic for
the same flashlight --- admittedly an outlandish pedagogical
contrivance --- but this time the battery is modeled as a 3~\unit{V}
independent voltage source in series with a resistance, $R_B$,
representing the internal resistance of the battery. The switch is
generic (for analysis purposes, we don't care if it latches or not),
the negative terminal of the battery is connected explicitly to the
lamp, and that node is connected to ground.

    \end{circuitikz}
    \caption{Analysis}

\end{figure}


\section{Alternating Current}

When we speak of an \term{alternating current}, \term{AC}, we are
usually referring to a sinusoidally time-varying \emph{voltage}
(potential difference). The US domestic standard service \gVp at
\gf AC supply can be described by:
\[
v(t) = 120\sqrt{2}\cos(60\cdot 2\pi t+\phi)\qquad\bunit{V}
\]

\ldots where $t$ is time and $\phi$ is some arbitrary phase shift that
depends on what you define as ``time zero'', $t=0$. If you synchronize
your ``time zero'' to a peak, then $\phi=0$ and the potential
difference varies with time as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ac}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onewide]{ac}
  \caption{US Domestic Supply --- \gVp at \gf AC}
  \label{fig:ac}
\end{figure}

\gVm is the \term{root mean squared} (\term{RMS}) voltage. The
mathematically convenient \term{peak} value is $\sqrt{2}$ times the
RMS voltage, \gVp, and half the \term{peak-to-peak} value, which is about
\gVpp in this case.
\[
V_\mathrm{pp} = 2 V_\mathrm{p}
\]

\[
V_\mathrm{RMS} = \frac{V_\mathrm{p}}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Assuming linearity, the associated current will also vary
sinusoidally, but will not generally, or even often, be
\term{in-phase}. Both passive energy-storage elements --- inductors
and capacitors --- and many active nonlinear elements --- such as
transistors --- alter the phase relationship between voltage and
current.

Conventionally, $\cos$, rather than $\sin$, is used to represent
sinusoidally varying signals. The reason for this is that it is highly
convenient to represent such signals as the real part of a complex
exponential:
\[
v(t) = \Re(V_\mathrm{p}\cdot e^{j(\omega t+\phi)}) = V_\mathrm{p}\cos(\omega t+\phi)
\]

For a common/fixed frequency, $\omega$, this representation can be
plotted as an arrow on an Argand diagram showing the magnitude and
phase of the signal: $v(t)$ can be written $V_\mathrm{p}\angle\phi$,
where the frequency is implied or understood from context. In our
case, this will almost always be \gf corresponding to the US
mains supply.

This representation, called a \term{phasor}, is convenient because
ordinary complex arithmetic yields correct results. Voltages,
currents, and the relationships between them can all be represented as
complex numbers, and ordinary complex arithmetic yields correct
magnitudes and phase relationships.

For example, if we add two signals of differing amplitude and phase,
but the same frequency:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:acsum}
v(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi) + B\cos(\omega t + \theta)
\end{equation}

It is not immediately obvious what the resultant waveform, $v$, should
look like, but these can be added graphically --- just like vectors in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ or complex numbers --- as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:phasor}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onenarrow]{phasor}
  \caption{Phasors Use Ordinary Complex Arithmetic}
  \label{fig:phasor}
\end{figure}

The sum of \eqref{eqn:acsum} depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:phasor} could
equally be written in phasor short-hand as:
\[
C\angle\psi = A\angle\phi + B\angle\theta
\]


\subsection{Fourier Analysis}

The assumption of sinusoidality is not greatly limiting, since any
periodic real function (or the periodic extension of any function of
limited domain) can be expressed as the sum of a (potentially
infinite) number of sinusoids via the Fourier transform, closely
related to Fourier series and the Laplace transform.



\section{Circuit Elements}

\subsection{Ideal Sources}
\label{sec:sources}

\subsection{Independent Voltage Source}
\label{sec:ivs}
The \term{independent voltage source} (\term{IVS}) is an ideal circuit
element used in analysis. It maintains its labeled potential
difference \emph{no matter what}. The 9V DC source shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ivs}, for example, maintains a 9V potential difference
at its terminals whether 1~\unit{\mu A} is drawn from it or 1\unit{GA}
is drawn from it.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) to [V=$9~\unit{V}$] (0,2);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{A 9~\unit{V} Independent Voltage Source}
  \label{fig:ivs}
\end{figure}

It should be clear that no such thing could exist in reality, but in
conjunction with other ideal elements, can be used to model real
components. A battery, for example, can be modeled as an independent
voltage source in series with a resistance.

Equally, an independent voltage source can be synthesized,
approximately and within limits, by a \term{voltage regulator}.

It would clearly be a contradiction to have two different voltage
sources connected together. In particular, this includes the ideal
\term{short circuit}, which is (by definition) an independent voltage
source of zero volts. Think of it this way: by Ohm's Law, such a
voltage source would have to supply infinite current.

A sinusoidal voltage source may be as depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:sinsrc}. There is no standard for sinusoidal sources,
so whether it is a voltage or a current source or whether the value is
a peak, peak-to-peak, or RMS voltage is a matter of labeling and
context.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) to [sV=$120~\unit{V}$] (0,2);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{A 120~\unit{V} Sinusoidal Voltage Source}
  \label{fig:sinsrc}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Controlled/Dependent Voltage Source}
\label{sec:cvs}
The \term{dependent voltage source} is an ideal circuit element used
in analysis. It maintains a voltage at its terminals that is a
function of some \emph{other} voltage or current in the same circuit.

Figure~\ref{fig:vcvs} shows a \term{voltage-controlled voltage source}
(\term{VCVS}). These are not terribly useful for modeling other
components, but can be synthesized, within limits, by real components.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) to [cV=$3v_x~\unit{V}$] (0,2);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{A Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source}
  \label{fig:vcvs}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Independent Current Source}
\label{sec:ics}

The \term{independent current source} (\term{ICS}) is the
\term{current} analog of the independent voltage source, above
(\S\ref{sec:ivs}), this time maintaining an output \term{current} no
matter what.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) to [I=$1~\unit{A}$] (0,2);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{An Independent Current Source}
  \label{fig:ics}
\end{figure}

Again it is used in analysis, no such thing really exists, but it can
be synthesized (within limits) using real-world components.

Just like it was a contradiction to have an IVS connected to an ideal
\term{short} circuit, it is a contradiction to connect an ICS to an
ideal \term{open} circuit: it can't maintain its labeled current if
there's no circuit for it to flow through. Equivalently, an ideal open
circuit is equivalent to a zero-current ICS.

\subsection{Controlled/Dependent Current Source}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) to [cI=$3v_x~\unit{A}$] (0,2);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{A Voltage-Controlled Current Source}
  \label{fig:vccs}
\end{figure}

The \term{controlled current source} (\term{CCS}) is, as you can
doubtless guess by now, the \term{current} analog of the controlled
voltage source, above (\S\ref{sec:cvs}), this time maintaining an
output \term{current} that is a function of some other voltage or
current in the circuit.

Figure~\ref{fig:vccs} shows a \term{voltage-controlled current
  source}. A VCCS can be used to model a field-effect transistor (FET)
or a vacuum tube. The constant of proportionality (or function), ``3''
in Fig~\ref{fig:vccs}, has dimensions of \term{amperes per volt} or
\term{conductance}. In the context of modeling a FET, it is called
``transconductance''.

A \term{bipolar junction transistor} (\term{BJT}) behaves more like a
\term{current-controlled current source}.


\subsection{Passive Linear Circuit Elements}

\subsubsection{Resistor}

\tikz \draw (0,0) to [R=$40~\unit{\Omega}$] (2,0);

An ideal resistor has resistance as its sole characteristic and
perfectly obeys Ohm's Law, i.e. it is perfectly linear.

A \emph{real} resistor exhibits non-idealities, which may include
inaccuracy, non-linearity, temperature sensitivity, inductance, and capacitance.

For example, a wire-wound resistor with a nominal value of
40~\unit{\Omega}, such as the one inside the model of auto alternator we
saw in class\footnote{A \com{Remy Delco 27SI}.}, may have a tolerance
of as much as 10\%, meaning that it's actual resistance could be
anywhere between 36~\unit{\Omega} and 44~\unit{\Omega}. 

Being ``wire-wound'' means that it is a coil of resistance wire wound
around a non-conductive former. It therefore exhibits some
\term{inductance}, which is irrelevant for DC. The inductance would
have negligible \term{reactance} at low AC frequencies, but might
render such a resistor unsuitable for high-frequency use.

\subsubsection{Capacitor}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{\twowide}
    \centering
    \begin{circuitikz}
      \draw (0,0) to [C=$1~\unit{\mu F}$] (2,0);
    \end{circuitikz}
    \caption{Symbol}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{\twowide}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\twowide]{capacitors}
    \caption{Components}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Typical Capacitors}
  \label{fig:caps}
\end{figure}

An ideal capacitor is completely characterized by a constant
\term{capacitance}, $C$, measured in \term{farads}, symbol~\unit{F}.

The prototypical capacitor consists of two parallel conductive plates
separated by a non-conductive material or \term{dielectric}. It can be
shown that a parallel plate capacitor having two plates of area $A$,
separated by a distance $d$, filled with a dielectric of
\term{permittivity} $\epsilon$, has a capacitance given
  by\footnote{This is idealized and might more accurately be described
    as the capacitance of a section of area $A$ of an infinite
    parallel plate capacitor or at least one so large that the
    different behavior at the edges, called \term{fringing} can be
    neglected.}:
\[
C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}\qquad\bunit{F}
\]

The relationship between current and voltage in an ideal capacitor is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cdvdt}
i(t) = C\deedee{v(t)}{t}
\end{equation}
Equivalently:
\[
v(t) = \frac{1}{C}\int i(t)\dee{t}
\]

The energy stored in the electric field of a capacitance of
$C~\unit{F}$, charged to a constant voltage, $V$, is given by:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2\qquad\bunit{J}
\]

\paragraph{Transient Behavior}
\label{sec:rcstep}

Suppose a completely discharged 1~\unit{\mu F} ideal capacitor is
connected at $t=0$ (by throwing a switch) to a \gVdc battery having an
internal resistance of \gR as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rcseries}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) node[ground] {};
    \draw (0,0) to [V=$\gVdc$] (0,2);
    \draw (0,2) to [R=$\gR$, v=$v_\mathrm{R}$] (2,2);
    \draw (2,2) to [spst] (4,2);
    \draw (4,2) to [C=$\gC$, v=$v_\mathrm{C}$] (4,0);
    \draw (4,0) to [short] (0,0);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{A Capacitor Connected to a Battery}
  \label{fig:rcseries}
\end{figure}

By Kirchoff's Voltage Law (the sum of the voltages around a loop is zero),
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rckvl}
v_\mathrm{R} + v_\mathrm{C} = V_\mathrm{B}\quad \left(\gVdc\right)
\end{equation}

There is only one possible current path, so:
\[
i_\mathrm{R} = i_\mathrm{C}
\]

By substitution, using~\eqref{eqn:vir} and~\eqref{eqn:cdvdt}:
\[
\frac{v_\mathrm{R}}{R} = C\deedee{v_\mathrm{C}}{t}
\]
or, by~\eqref{eqn:rckvl}\footnote{It's slightly more convenient to
  solve for $v_\mathrm{R}$ than $v_\mathrm{C}$}:
\[
\frac{1}{RC} v_\mathrm{R} = \deedee{t} V_\mathrm{B} - \deedee{t} v_\mathrm{R}
\]
The battery voltage is constant, so rearranging:
\[
\deedee{t} v_\mathrm{R} + \frac{1}{RC} v_\mathrm{R} = 0
\]
The solution to this well-known homogeneous ODE (subject to the
initial condition $v_\mathrm{R}(0)=V_\mathrm{B}$) is:
\[
v_\mathrm{R}(t) = V_\mathrm{B} e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\]
By Ohm's Law:
\[
i(t) = \frac{v_\mathrm{R}(t)}{R} = \frac{V_\mathrm{B}}{R} e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\]
And, by~\eqref{eqn:rckvl}:
\[
v_\mathrm{C}(t) = V_\mathrm{B}\left(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right)
\]
Plotting with the values for $V_\mathrm{B}$, $R$, and $C$ given above
(\gVdc, \gR, and \gC, respectively) yields Figure~\ref{fig:rcstep}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onewide]{rcstep}
  \caption{Step Response of a Series RC Circuit}
  \label{fig:rcstep}
\end{figure}

The value $RC$ is called the \term{time constant} and has units of
seconds\footnote{A farad is a second per ohm.}:
\[
\tau = RC = \gR\times\gC = 2\times 10^{-6}\bunit{s}
\]


\paragraph{DC Behavior}

It should be clear from the foregoing analysis that the steady-state
DC behavior of a capacitor is to block DC current flow. In other
words, a capacitor behaves like an \emph{open circuit} to DC.


\paragraph{AC Behavior}

The capacitor's frequency-dependent AC analog of resistance is
\term{capacitive reactance}. It is inversely proportional to
capacitance and frequency and is given by:
\[
X_\mathrm{C} = \frac{1}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{2\pi f C} \qquad\bunit{\Omega}
\]

Dimensionally:
\[
X_\mathrm{C} = \frac{1}{\omega\bunit{1}{s}\cdot C~\bunit{F}} = \unit{s}\cdot\unit{1}{F} = \unit{s}\left(\unit{\Omega}{s}\right) = \unit{\Omega}
\]

In short, a fixed-value ideal capacitors's reactance is inversely
proportional to frequency. This is consistent with what we know about
the capacitor's DC behavior since, loosely speaking: at zero frequency
(DC), the reactance is infinite.

Since an ideal capacitor is a pure energy storage device, under
quasi-static conditions (AC voltage applied for a long time), any
power stored during one part of a cycle is returned during another
part of the cycle.

If we were to apply the US standard domestic mains voltage to our
\gC capacitor, we would see the voltage and current shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:capac}. Note that the current scale is
\emph{milliamps}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onewide]{capac}
  \caption{Current Leads Voltage in a Capacitor}
  \label{fig:capac}
\end{figure}

The RMS current in Figure~\ref{fig:capac} is
$\approx\giCm$. In time, the current leads voltage by 90\deg.


\paragraph{Colloquialisms}

A real capacitor is sometimes called a \term{cap}.


\subsubsection{Inductor}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{\twowide}
    \centering
    \begin{circuitikz}
      \draw (0,0) to [L=$1~\unit{mH}$] (2,0);
    \end{circuitikz}
    \caption{Symbol}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{\twowide}

    \includegraphics[width=\twowide]{inductors}
    \caption{Components}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Typical Inductors}
  \label{fig:coils}
\end{figure}

An ideal inductor is completely characterized by a constant
\term{inductance}, $L$, measured in \term{henries}, symbol~\unit{H}.

The prototypical inductor consists of a helical coil of perfectly
conductive wire wound on a non-conductive cylindrical \term{core}.

It can be shown that a helical coil of length $l$ and cross-sectional
area $A$ with $n$ turns, surrounded and filled by a medium of
\term{magnetic permeability} $\mu$, has an inductance given by:
\[
L = \frac{\mu n^2 A}{l}\qquad\bunit{H}
\]

The relationship between current and voltage in an ideal inductor is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ldidt}
v(t) = L\deedee{i(t)}{t}
\end{equation}

Or, equivalently:
\[
i(t) = \frac{1}{L}\int v(t)\dee{t}
\]

The energy stored in the magnetic field of an inductance of
$L~\unit{H}$ carrying a constant current, $I$, is given by:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} L I^2\qquad\bunit{J}
\]


\paragraph{Transient Behavior}

Suppose a completely discharged \gL ideal inductor is connected at
$t=0$ (by throwing a switch) to a \gVdc battery having an internal
resistance of \gR as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rlseries}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) node[ground] {};
    \draw (0,0) to [V=$\gVdc$] (0,2);
    \draw (0,2) to [R=$\gR$, v=$v_\mathrm{R}$] (2,2);
    \draw (2,2) to [spst] (4,2);
    \draw (4,2) to [L=$\gL$, v=$v_\mathrm{L}$] (4,0);
    \draw (4,0) to [short] (0,0);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{An Inductor Connected to a Battery}
  \label{fig:rlseries}
\end{figure}

Following \emph{exactly} the same procedure as for the analagous
capacitor circuit in \S\ref{sec:rcstep}, above, we find that:
\[
i(t) = \frac{V_\mathrm{B}}{R}\left(1-e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}\right)
\]

\[
v_\mathrm{R}(t) = V_\mathrm{B}\left(1-e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}\right)
\]

\[
v_\mathrm{L}(t) = V_\mathrm{B}e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}
\]

Plotting with the values for $V_\mathrm{B}$, $R$, and $L$ given above
(\gVdc, \gR, and \gL, respectively) yields Figure~\ref{fig:rlstep}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onewide]{rlstep}
  \caption{Step Response of a Series RL Circuit}
  \label{fig:rlstep}
\end{figure}

In this case, the time constant is\footnote{A henry is an ohm-second.}:
\[
\tau = \frac{L}{R} = \frac{\gL}{\gR} = 2\times10^{-3}\quad\bunit{s}
\]


\paragraph{DC Behavior}

It should be clear from the foregoing analysis that the steady-state
DC behavior of an inductor is to conduct current. In other words, an
inductor behaves like a \emph{short circuit} to DC.


\paragraph{AC Behavior}

The inductor's frequency-dependent AC analog of resistance is
\term{inductive reactance}. It is directly proportional to inductance
and frequency and is given by:
\[
X_\mathrm{L} = \omega L = 2\pi f L\qquad\bunit{\Omega}
\]

Dimensionally:
\[
X_\mathrm{L} = \omega\bunit{1}{s}\cdot L~\bunit{H} = \unit{H}{s} = \left(\unit{\Omega\cdot s}\right)\cdot\unit{1}{s} = \unit{\Omega}
\]

In short, a fixed-value ideal inductor's reactance increases linearly
with frequency. This is consistent with what we already know about the
inductor's DC behavior since, loosely speaking: at zero frequency
(DC), the reactance is zero (a short circuit).

Since an ideal inductor is a pure energy storage device, under
quasi-static conditions (AC voltage applied for a long time), any
power stored during one part of a cycle is returned during another
part of the cycle.

If we were to apply the US standard domestic mains voltage to our
\gL inductor, we would see the voltage and current shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:indac}. Note that the current scale is \emph{amperes}
(to handle the \giLp peak current, this would have to be one
hefty inductor).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onewide]{indac}
  \caption{Voltage Leads Current in an Inductor}
  \label{fig:indac}
\end{figure}

The RMS current in Figure~\ref{fig:indac} is $\approx\giLm$. In time,
voltage leads current by 90\deg in an inductor.

\paragraph{Colloquialisms}

A real inductor is often colloquially called a \term{coil}. 

A \term{choke} is an inductor used to suppress high-frequency
currents.


\subsubsection{Complex Impedance}

\tikz \draw (0,0) to [generic=$1+\mathrm{j}5~\unit{\Omega}$] (2,0);

A \term{complex impedance}, $Z$ has a resistive component, $R$, and a
reactive component, $X$:

\[
Z = R + \mathrm{j}X
\]

The reactive component $X$ may be a capacitive reactance:
\[
Z = R - \mathrm{j}X_\mathrm{C} = R - \mathrm{j}\cdot\frac{1}{\omega C}
\]
or an inductive reactance:
\[
Z = R + \mathrm{j}X_\mathrm{L} = R + \mathrm{j}\cdot\omega L
\]

If the reactive component of impedance is \emph{negative}, $\Im(Z)<0$, the impedance is \term{capacitive}.

If the reactive component of impedance is \emph{positive}, $\Im(Z)>0$, the impedance is \term{inductive}.

If the reactive component of impedance is \emph{zero}, $\Im(Z)=0$, the impedance is \term{purely resistive}.

Suppose we consider a series RL circuit --- similar to that considered
before --- consisting of a \gR resistor and a \gL inductor in series
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:indload}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) node[ground] {};
    \draw (0,0) to [sV=$v$] (0,4);
    \draw (0,4) to [short, i=$i$] (3,4);
    \draw (3,4) to [R=$\gR$] (3,2);
    \draw (3,2) to [L=$\gL$] (3,0);
    \draw (3,0) to [short] (0,0);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{An Inductive Load Connected to an AC Voltage Source}
  \label{fig:indload}
\end{figure}


Its impedance at \gf is:
\[
Z = 2 + \mathrm{j} \cdot 120\pi \cdot 4\times 10^{-3} \approx \gZ
\]

If we applied the US domestic mains --- \gVm at \gf --- to this
impedance, the current would be as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:srlac}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onewide]{srlac}
  \caption{Voltage and Current in an Inductive Impedance}
  \label{fig:srlac}
\end{figure}

We can see that voltage is still leading current, as we would expect
from the inductance, but by a bit less than 45\deg, not 90\deg.

The exact relationship can be computed surprisingly easily: we just
apply Ohm's Law using phasors:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:acohms}
i = \frac{\abs{V_\mathrm{p}}\angle0}{Z} = \frac{(120\sqrt{2})\angle0}{2+\mathrm{j}1.508} \approx \frac{169.7\angle0}{2.505\angle37.02\deg} = 67.74\angle{-37.02}
\end{equation}
This tells us that the current peaks at \giLp and lags the voltage by
\gabsArgZ. Equivalently, we can say that \emph{voltage leads current}
by \gabsArgZ.


\subsubsection{Transformer}



\subsection{AC Power}

Because of the phase relationship between current and voltage, AC
\emph{power} is not as simple as the DC case. Only in the case of a
purely resistive load --- one with no reactive component, capacitive
or inductive --- is RMS power, the product of RMS voltage and RMS
current, meaningful.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{circuitikz}
    \draw (0,0) node[ground] {};
    \draw (0,0) to [sV=$\gVm$] (0,2);
    \draw (0,2) to [short] (2,2);
    \draw (2,2) to [generic=$Z$] (2,0);
    \draw (2,0) to [short] (0,0);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{A Generic Load Connected to an AC Source}
  \label{fig:acload}
\end{figure}

Provided that we deal in complex numbers, however, power obeys a
simple and somewhat familiar equation, but note the complex conjugate
of the current:

\[
S = \bar{i} \times v
\]

Where $S$ is a complex number:

\[
S = P+\mathrm{j}Q
\]

Here $S$ is the \term{apparent power} in \term{volt-amperes}
(\unit{VA}), $P$ is the \term{real power} in watts (\unit{W}), and $Q$
is the \term{reactive power} in \term{reactive
  volt-amperes}\footnote{Or, if you prefer alignment with the
  abbreviation over grammar, ``volt-amperes, reactive'' or
  ``volt-amperes (reactive)''.} (\unit{VAr}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onewide]{acpower}
  \caption{AC Power: $S=P+\mathrm{j}Q$}
  \label{fig:acpower}
\end{figure}


If $Z$ in Figure~\ref{fig:acload} is the RL series arrangement of
Figure~\ref{fig:indload}, the voltage, current, and power phasors are
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pwrphasor}. Well, almost: the lengths of
the phasors in Figure~\ref{fig:pwrphasor} are $\log_{10}$ of their
normal linear values so we can ``see everything'', and we're more
interested in the phase relationships at this point.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onewide]{pwrphasor}
  \caption{Voltage, Current, and Power Phasors}
  \label{fig:pwrphasor}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Power Factor}

The \term{power factor} is the ratio of real to apparent power:
\[
\lambda = \frac{\abs{P}}{\abs{S}} = \cos\phi \qquad \in [0,1]
\]

A \term{purely resistive} load has a power factor of 1. A \term{purely
  inductive} load \emph{or} a \term{purely capacitive} load has a
power factor of 0, since there is no real power in either case: $P=0$.

A capacitive load is differentiated from an inductive load by
appending ``lagging'' in the case of an inductive load or ``leading''
in the case of an inductive load. In the context of power factor,
voltage is \emph{always} considered the reference. So if current lags
voltage, the load is inductive, and if current leads voltage, the load
is capacitive.

Looking at Figure~\ref{fig:pwrphasor} again, the current phasor (red)
appears clockwise of the voltage phasor (blue). The angle? We
calculated that in Equation~\ref{eqn:acohms}: \gArgZ. The angle
subtended by the apparent power, $S$, to the real axis is the same, so
the power factor in this case is \gPF.

Although the usual definition of power factor doesn't admit the
possibility of negative power factors, they have been used
historically with differing conventions and there is an argument that
``negative power'' is a more useful concept today, when domestic
rooftop solar and other small-scale generators have turned what would
traditionally have been loads into ``sometimes loads, sometimes
generators''.

Note that, in general, although we usually shorten ``ampere'' to
``amp'' colloquially, this is done less often with units that
``compound'' the ampere with other units, such as ampere-second (aka
coulomb, $1\unit{C}=1\unit{A\cdot s}$, volt-ampere (\unit{VA}), or
ampere-hour (\unit{Ah}).


\subsection{Lagging and Leading}

The issue of what is considered lagging and leading causes
considerable confusion.

Clearly, ``$X$ lags $Y$'' is the same as saying ``$Y$ leads
$X$''. Neither of these are meaningful if $X$ and $Y$ differ in
frequency, but their amplitudes are irrelevant: lagging and leading
are purely about time.

There are four sources of confusion:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Current and voltage vs. time plots ``look'' backwards (to many people at least);
  \item The standard mnemonic mixes \emph{current} and \emph{voltage} as the reference
  \item Power factor consistently uses \emph{voltage} as the reference
  \item A lagging (or leading) power factor phasor points different
    directions depending on what is plotted
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Backwards Plots}

If $X$ leads $Y$, this means that $X$'s sinusoid appears shifted
\emph{to the left} with respect to $Y$'s. $X$ is leading \emph{in
  time}, so its ``events'' (zero-crossings, peaks, troughs) happen
\emph{sooner} (to the left).

This can be confusing, because it's the opposite way around from what
one might intuitively and reasonably expect looking at a graph: that
``leading'' means ``looks shifted to the right'', which is the exact
opposite of what it really means: if $X$ \emph{leads} $Y$, then $X$
appears shifted to the \emph{left} --- sooner in time --- with respect
to $Y$.

Similarly, if $X$ \emph{lags} $Y$, then $X$ appears shifted \emph{to
  the right} --- later in time --- with respect to $Y$.

\subsubsection{Mnemonic Mixes Reference Signals}

The (strained) mnemonic used to remember the ``what leads
what'' in inductors and capacitors is:

\begin{quote}
\centering
ELI the ICE man
\end{quote}

Where ``E'' stands for voltage, ``I'' stands for current, ``L''
stands for inductance, and ``C'' stands for capacitance,

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf ELI} means ``voltage leads current in an inductor''\footnote{The ``L'' for inductor is ``in'' the middle, gettit? Yes, I think it's pretty stupid too.}
  \item {\bf ICE} means ``current leads voltage in a capacitor''
\end{itemize}

The problem here is that the relationship, ``leads'', is implied. It's
easy to misremember it as ``lags'' and get everything backwards.


\subsubsection{Power Factor Uses Voltage as Reference}

Mercifully and sensibly, power factor consistently uses voltage as the reference:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If PF is ``lagging'', then current \emph{lags} voltage
    (inductive), and the current phasor points ``down'', somewhere in
    the lower right quadrant.
  \item If PF is ``leading'', then current \emph{leads} voltage (capacitive), and the current phasor points ``up'', somewhwere in the upper right quadrant.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Phasors Point Different Directions}

The current phasor for a lagging power factor points down, but the
power phasor for a lagging power factor points up. An inductive
impedance, though not a phasor, can be plotted on the same Argand
diagram and points up.

The current phasor for a leading power factor points up, but the power
phasor for a leading power factor points down. A capacitive impedance
points down.

Though it makes sense when you work through it, it can be confusing
keeping all of this ``straight'' in your head.


\section{Essential Principles}

\subsection{Kirchoff's Voltage Law}

The sum of the potential differences around a closed loop is zero (just conservation of potential energy).

\subsection{Kirchoff's Current Law}

The sum of the currents into a node is zero (just conservation of mass: where else could electrons go?)

\subsection{Th\'evenin's Theorem}

Any linear one-port circuit is equivalent to a voltage source in
series with an impedance.

\subsection{Norton's Theorem}

Any linear one-port network is equivalent to a \emph{current} source
in \term{parallel} with an impedance.

\subsection{Duality of Th\'evenin's and Norton's Theorems}

Th\'evenin's Theorem is the dual of Norton's theorem (next): any
one-port network that has a Norton equivalent circuit has a
Th\'evenin's equivalent circuit and {\it vice versa}.

The Norton equivalent and Th\'evenin equivalent impedances for any
network are the same.

In practice, Th\'evenin equivalent circuits are more common than
Norton equivalent circuits.


\subsection{Maximum Power Transfer (MPT) Theorem}

Any Th\'evenin equivalent one-port network transfers maximum power to
a load when the load's impedance is the complex conjugate of the
network's Th\`evenin equivalent series impedance.

By duality, this applies equally to a Norton equivalent circuit.


\subsection{Semiconductors}

\subsubsection{Diode}

Semiconductor diodes can be, broadly speaking, divided into
\term{small signal} and \term{power} types. Small signal diodes come
in a bewildering number of varieties\footnote{Even leaving aside
  light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, photodiodes, etc.} (microwave
resonant tunnel diodes, anyone?). For power purposes, however, there
are relatively few significant variations.

Figure~\ref{fig:ivdiode} shows a cartoon representation of the
current-voltage behavior of a typical semiconductor diode. {\bf Note
  that this is not to scale: }the reverse current is typically
minuscule (sub-\unit{\mu A}) compared to the forward current
(\unit{mA} to \unit{kA} depending on application), at least until
breakdown, and the reverse breakdown voltage is typically orders of
magnitude larger (tens to thousands of volts) than the forward voltage
drop (hundreds of~\unit{mV}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\onenarrow]{ivdiode}
  \caption{Generic Diode I-V Characteristic Cartoon}
  \label{fig:ivdiode}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Rectifier}

Rectifier diodes are power diodes available in current ratings from
perhaps 500~\unit{mA} to 10~\unit{kA}.

The principal ratings are the maximum forward current, peak inverse
voltage (PIV), forward voltage drop. A typical small ``vanilla''
silicon rectifier can carry a few amps, has a PIV ratings between
maybe 100 and 1,000 volts, drops about 0.7~\unit{V}, and can switch
fast enough for mains service.

A \term{Schottky diode} has a lower forward voltage drop and higher
switching speed, suitable for high-speed switching circuits, but at
the expense of much lower PIV rating.

\paragraph{Zener Diode}

A \term{Zener diode} is a diode engineered so that the reverse
breakdown voltage\footnote{Colloquially refereed to as ``the knee''.}
is consistent, non-destructive, and nearly constant with
current. Zener diodes are typically used as voltage references.

Many diodes termed ``Zener diodes'' are technically \term{avalanche
  diodes} are there are two subtly different reverse breakdown
effects: the Zener effect and the avalanche effect.

\section{Rotational Kinetic Energy}

The blade assembly of a wind turbine can be viewed as a device that
converts the translational kinetic energy of the wind to rotational
kinetic energy (RKE).

Rotational kinetic energy (in joules) of the ``turning parts'' ---
including the blade, hub, shaft, etc. --- is given by\footnote{Note
  the similarity to the expression for \emph{translational} KE:
  $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rke}
E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2
\end{equation}

Where $I$ is the \term{moment of inertia} (in \unit{kg\cdot m^2}) of
the blade assembly around the hub axis and $\omega$ is its
\emph{angular velocity} (in \unit{rad}{s}). 

The rotational \emph{power} (in watts) is, via Newton's Laws, the time
derivative of the RKE:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rpow}
P_{rot} = \frac{I}{2}\deedee{\omega^2}{t} = I\omega
\end{equation}

\section{Generator}

A \emph{generator} is a device that converts rotational energy (or
power) into electrical energy (or power).

The conversion efficiency of a large generator can be as high as 97\%.

There is a saying in electrical engineering that ``all generators are AC generators''.

By way of example, \term{moment of inertia} is the analog of {mass} in
translational mechanics. In the same way as the mass, $m$, (in
\unit{kg}) can be viewed as the property of an object that determines
the force, $F$, (in \unit{N}) required for a particular \emph{linear}
acceleration, $a$, (in \unit{m}{s^2}) --- $F=ma \implies
m=\frac{F}{a}$ --- moment of inertia, I, determines the \emph{torque},
$T$, (in \unit{N\cdot m}) required for a particular \emph{angular}
acceleration (in \unit{rad}{s^2}): $\tau=I\alpha \implies
I=\frac{\tau}{\alpha}$.
